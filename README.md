# EasyAVR-Tada68
Added TADA68 support for [Easy AVR](https://github.com/dhowland/EasyAVR).

# Instructions
You can essentially follow the instructions here: 
https://github.com/dhowland/EasyAVR#supporting-custom-boards

__**TL;DR for first time EasyAVR users**__ - Place the .py and .cfg files in their appropriate home in your `.EasyAVR` folder after running `run.bat` once. In the `New Default Layout` dialog, be sure to select either `ANSI` or `ISO` from the `Available Layouts` dropdown.

## TODO
- [ ] Confirm that my layouts are configured correctly by testing on an actual TADA68...
  - [ ] ANSI
  - [ ] ISO
- [ ] LED support
